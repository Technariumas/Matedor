In recent years, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate">Club Mate</a> - a sweetened and carbonated version of the beverage from Germany has become popular among hackers and others around the world.
Initiatives like <a href="http://www.hackpittsburgh.org/brewing-open-mate-soda">Open Mate</a> have created recipes and DIY instructions for Mate soda home brewing. Matédor is an adaptation of Open Mate's recipe to create a syrup for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodastream">Soda Stream</a> carbonators.

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

Yields 1 cup of syrup
-- 1 cup water
-- 50g Yerba Mate leaves
--· 1/4 cup raw sugar
-- 3/4 cup agave syrup
--· 3 tsp lemon juice
--· 1 tbsp guarana powder (optional, and you might want to cut it down a bit)

<h2>Preparation:</h2>

Simmer the tea without boiling for 10 minutes. Stir in the sugar, agave syrup, guarana powder, lemon juice. Mix until sugar has completely dissolved. Strain into a container (thick paper tissue in a colander works fine). Carbonate water, add roughly 1/3 cup of the syrup into 1l of water.
